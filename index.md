### This repository uses flask to demonstrate the powerfull capabilities of python as an APP status backend.

## There are many ways to use it, and it operates with POST requests to update the app status.

## You can send the following:
 - id -> Which is the name of the app and it's a keyword.
 - status -> Which is the status of the app, and it needs to be in the allowed app status list.
 - exception -> If specified it should show why the app is working or not!
 - description -> It will be used as a tooltip to show the function of the app.
